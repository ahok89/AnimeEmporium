# AnimeEmporium

## About This Project

We wanted to create a community where people who love anime can come together and enjoy talking about anime.

In Anime Emporium, you are able to make a profile, which will be displayed on most of the pages you can view, and search random anime that may interest you by clicking on the randomizer on the right hand side of the page.

You can search in the search bar or the genre dropdown. This will lead you to the search results page where you are able to further select the anime you searched. Then you can video the profile page of the specific anime you have searched.

You are able to create a watch and a completed list of animes. You can attend meetups and chat with fellow anime lovers.

This site is suppose to bring us closer together even after conventions are over with.
